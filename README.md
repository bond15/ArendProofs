# Arend Proofs

See the brownbag for a very quick demonstration of the Arend Proof assistant and some features of cubical type theory.
I also encode some algebraic structures and their laws as typeclasses (Functor, Applicative, Monad) and give proof for some instances.

This was joint work with Imran Settuba (i-walker) as we explore HoTT.
